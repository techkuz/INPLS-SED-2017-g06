\chapter{Analysis Models}
\label{chap:AM}

%This chapter provides a general overview of the main concepts gathered during
%the analysis phase, in particular those concerning the software system types
%(i.e. classes, datatypes, and enumerations), as well as the actors that
% interact with the software system through their interfaces. Figures included in the
%Messir Requirement Document that correspond to the  the \glspl{Concept Model}
% and the \glspl{Environment Model} could be also included in this chapter, as a means of synthesizing what
%are the requirements to which the design is supposed to sketch a solution.


\section{Flow-orineted model}
This model provides an indication of how data objects are transformed by a set
of processing functions.
