\section{Issue 1}
When administrator tries to log in through the admin system, it doesn't
accept that which is written in the readme file.\\

\noindent \textbf{Corrective actions}\\

1. The simplest way to know if all the VM are up and running is looking at the
messages that appear after you type vagrant up \\
2. Other thing you could try is to type in your console: vagrant box list .It
shows the different vagrant boxes already downloaded in your machine.\\
3. Also in case of using Vagrant project you need to check if all virtual
machines were started correctly. In particular you should login into the server
VM and see if the server has been started: you can do it by typing:  ps -ax |
grep java which displays all Java processes running on the machine.

\section{Issue 2}
At the moment system doesnot support mobile platforms such as iOS and Android.
